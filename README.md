# ROTATE A CABINET (or whatever)

Dated script that "rotates" an object using consequent  images as rotation frames.
Also demonstrates object color switching.

Though obviously successful use of the scripts reliaes on thye biggest part on frames quality and prcise, still the animation script substitites a quick hack into deploying the "3D" kind of rotating.
